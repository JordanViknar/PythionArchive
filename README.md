# Pythion
Tic-Tac-Toe but in Python. This is a really old French high-school projet from around the end of 2019, and only here for archive purposes.

Pythion = Python + "Morpion" *(Tic-Tac-Toe in French)*

## Usage :
The scripts should run fine, as long as your environment fullfills the dependencies (EduPython was used to develop it, so try it as a last resort if you're French). If you want to use sound features, make sure you're running Windows and have the files
- music.wav
- vsmusic.wav
- tighter.wav
- vstighter.wav
- victory.wav

ready at the root of the project. They can be any WAV files.
The original files (not present in this repository) are actually from the Tetris NES OST, so get those if you want the "proper" experience.

## What version do I use ?

The "vsordi" version makes you fight against the computer, who just simply randomly selects an available case *(look, I was in high school at the time, don't complain)*.
The other version requires a second player, and that player will be against you.
Part of the soundtrack is different between versions.

Oh and yeah, since this is as basic as can be : **the whole game plays in the console**.
